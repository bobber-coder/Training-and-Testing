# CLAUDE.md — RSV / Retrouver Sa Voie

## Who is the client?
Client: Brigitte Pogonat
Brand: Retrouver Sa Voie (RSV)
Website: https://www.brigittepogonat.com
Language: French-Canadian (Québécois)
Location: Québec, Canada

## What she does
Brigitte is a holistic life coach, somatic yoga teacher, and personal development educator with ~20 years of experience. She works with sensitive, deep, emotionally complex individuals — primarily women — helping them reconnect with their authentic self through:
- 1:1 coaching cycles (3, 5, or 8 sessions)
- Weekly somatic yoga (included with 5 & 8-session packages)
- Monthly specialized workshops (ateliers)
- A 9-month women-only immersive program (Voyage Immersif)
- Occasional retreats and masterclasses

## Brand voice & tone
- Deep, poetic, philosophical — not corporate
- Warm but grounded — not fluffy or superficial
- French-Canadian — write all copy in French unless specified
- She speaks TO the sensitive, the lost, the ones who feel "too much"
- Key phrases she uses: "Retrouver Sa Voie", "être organique", "actualisation de soi", "intégration", "karma", "chemin", "sensible", "profond(e)"
- Avoid: generic wellness clichés, toxic positivity, English unless asked

## Her audience
- Primarily French-speaking women
- Sensitive, introspective, spiritually curious
- Often feel misunderstood, stuck in patterns, disconnected from themselves
- Located in Québec + France + diaspora (6 France, rest Québec)
- Age range: roughly 25–50

## Current tools stack
- Email: Gmail / Google Workspace
- Video: Zoom (creates new links manually each time)
- Events: Eventbrite
- Email marketing: Mailchimp (~280 subscribers)
- Video content: Opus Clips + vidIQ + YouTube
- Payments: Interac e-transfer + Eventbrite (credit card)
- Scheduling: NO booking platform (all manual by email)
- CRM: NONE — uses Google Sheets manually
- Website: WordPress (brigittepogonat.com)
- Social: Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, Instagram

## Key pain points to solve
1. No booking system — all scheduling done by email back-and-forth
2. No CRM — client tracking is a manual Google Sheet
3. Zoom links created manually for every session
4. Post-event follow-up done manually (copy-paste email lists)
5. Mailchimp list updated manually after each event
6. Newsletter open rate dropped 40% → 20%, no funnel
7. Content production bottleneck — wants 1 short/day, managing 3-4/week
8. Revenue tracked by searching inbox for "Interac"
9. No lead tracking or funnel

## Automation priorities (in order)
1. Booking + Zoom + confirmation/reminder pipeline
2. Post-event Eventbrite → Mailchimp auto-sync
3. Content pipeline (transcript → titles, descriptions, chapters)
4. Newsletter drafting automation
5. Financial tracking dashboard
