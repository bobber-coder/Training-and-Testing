# CLAUDE.md — RSV / Retrouver Sa Voie
## Who is the client?
Client: Brigitte Pogonat
Brand: Retrouver Sa Voie (RSV)
Website: https://www.brigittepogonat.com
Language: French-Canadian (Québécois)
Location: Québec, Canada
## What she does
Brigitte is a holistic life coach, somatic yoga teacher, and personal development educator with ~20 years of experience. She works with sensitive, deep, emotionally complex individuals — primarily women — helping them reconnect with their authentic self through:
- 1:1 coaching cycles (3, 5, or 8 sessions)
- Weekly somatic yoga (included with 5 & 8-session packages)
- Monthly specialized workshops (ateliers)
- A 9-month women-only immersive program (Voyage Immersif)
- Occasional retreats and masterclasses
## Brand voice & tone
- Deep, poetic, philosophical — not corporate
- Warm but grounded — not fluffy or superficial
- French-Canadian — write all copy in French unless specified
- She speaks TO the sensitive, the lost, the ones who feel "too much"
- Key phrases she uses: "Retrouver Sa Voie", "être organique", "actualisation de soi", "intégration", "karma", "chemin", "sensible", "profond(e)"
- Avoid: generic wellness clichés, toxic positivity, English unless asked
## Her audience
- Primarily French-speaking women
- Sensitive, introspective, spiritually curious
- Often feel misunderstood, stuck in patterns, disconnected from themselves
- Located in Québec + France + diaspora (6 France, rest Québec)
- Age range: roughly 25–50
## Current tools stack
- Email: Gmail / Google Workspace
- Video: Zoom (creates new links manually each time)
- Events: Eventbrite
- Email marketing: Mailchimp (~280 subscribers)
- Video content: Opus Clips + vidIQ + YouTube
- Payments: Interac e-transfer + Eventbrite (credit card)
- Scheduling: NO booking platform (all manual by email)
- CRM: NONE — uses Google Sheets manually
- Website: WordPress (brigittepogonat.com)
- Social: Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, Instagram
## Key pain points to solve
1. No booking system — all scheduling done by email (tried Calendly, didn't stick)
2. No CRM — client tracking is a manual Google Sheet (errors happen, has to dig through emails)
3. No tracking of coaching cycles — doesn't always know how many sessions a client has taken
4. Zoom links created manually for every session
5. Post-event follow-up done manually — email list copy-paste after every workshop
6. Mailchimp list updated manually after each event
7. Newsletter open rate dropped 40% → 20%, no funnel
8. Content posting is draining — YouTube, TikTok, FB all manual, energetically costly
9. Revenue/taxes not tracked properly — she now has to charge taxes, no system
10. Eventbrite + FB event creation + boosting all manual and heavy
11. Payment follow-up done by hand — she emails clients when instalments are due
12. No lead funnel — wants to shift from paid events to free entry point (free talk or free video) → coaching
## Automation priorities (in order)
1. Coaching platform / CRM — she researched Simply.Coach and likes it; needs booking, cycle tracking, client history, payments in ONE place
2. Booking + Zoom + confirmation/reminder pipeline (even if Simply.Coach handles this)
3. Lead funnel — free entry point (free call or free video) → automated follow-up → coaching offer
4. Post-event Eventbrite → Mailchimp auto-sync + automated follow-up email
5. Social media scheduling — she wants posting automated, it's energetically draining
6. Content pipeline (transcript → titles, descriptions, chapters, shorts)
7. Newsletter drafting automation
8. Financial/tax tracking dashboard — she now charges taxes, needs proper tracking

## Notes
- Client is francophone — all deliverables in French unless otherwise specified
- She has a collaborator named Sylvie who handles some design/banners
- Video editor: Yann
- She values depth, authenticity, and human connection above all
- Do NOT make her sound like a typical wellness influencer
- She tried Calendly once — it didn't stick. Any booking solution needs to feel simple and human, not corporate
- She's aware the current setup only works because the business is small — she WANTS to scale and knows it needs to change
- She explicitly said she's shifting strategy: fewer paid events, more free entry points (free call / free video) into a funnel
- She asked about "coach platforms" — Simply.Coach is her top candidate (check it before recommending alternatives)
- Tax tracking is a new pain point — she recently became required to charge taxes and has no system for it
